# ðŸš° Drinking Water Potability Prediction using H2O AutoML

This project was completed as part of **SkillCraft - Task 4**, aimed at applying real-world machine learning techniques to predict the **potability of drinking water** using **H2O AutoML**.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To build an efficient machine learning model that predicts whether water is safe for drinking based on its physicochemical properties.

## ðŸ§ª Dataset
The dataset contains various water quality features such as:
- pH
- Hardness
- Solids
- Chloramines
- Sulfate
- Conductivity
- Organic Carbon
- Trihalomethanes
- Turbidity

Target variable:
- `Potability` (0 = Not Safe, 1 = Safe)

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **H2O AutoML**
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding feature distribution
   - Correlation heatmaps
3. **Modeling with H2O AutoML**
   - Automatically selects the best ML model
   - Provides leaderboard of model performances
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - AUC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall
5. **Visualization**
   - Graphs showing feature importance and model performance

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Achieved high accuracy using H2Oâ€™s ensemble models.
- Identified key features influencing water potability.

## âœ… Learnings
- Hands-on experience with AutoML
- How to automate model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Real-world data cleaning and analysis
